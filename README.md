# UR-Simulation-in-Unity-Hardware-in-the-loop-Animation-of-Real-Robot-

**All the credit for original package and controller goes to [Long Qian](http://longqian.me/aboutme), [Shuyang Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuyang-shawn-chen-346ab6109) for creating the prefab and initial script.

This fork Simulates UR using joint angles being published by a real robot over TCP IP.
- Additions and Modifications are as follows:
#### - TCP server that can connect to real UR5/UR10
#### - Some modifications in the joint angle mapping to replicate actual robot. 
#### - Buttons for camera rotation.

You need to publish joint angles from UR script to this server in order to replicate motion.
